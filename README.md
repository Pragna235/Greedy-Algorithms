# Greedy-Algorithms
* Application of Greedy Approach - Write a program for the following scenario using greedy approach. 
<br>"A person has a logistics company that transports packets from different sources to destinations. The packet size comes in variety of dimensions and weights. A profit P is obtained by transporting the packet to the destination without any damage. A loss l is accrued if there is any damage to the packet.At an instace, he has n packets, and their respective weights, profits and losses.Help him find the optimal combination of packets i.e., maximum profit obtained including the losses.
<br>Time Complexity - O(n log n)
<br>Tip : Try to implement the program by calculating the (profit-loss) and weight ratios in place of profit and wieght ratios in the fractional knapsack
