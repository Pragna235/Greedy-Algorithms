* Application of Greedy Approach - Write a program for the following scenario using greedy approach.  (Fractional Knapsack)
<br>"A person has a logistics company that transports packets from different sources to destinations. The packet size comes in variety of dimensions and weights. A profit P is obtained by transporting the packet to the destination without any damage. A loss l is accrued if there is any damage to the packet.At an instace, he has n packets, and their respective weights, profits and losses.Help him find the optimal combination of packets i.e., maximum profit obtained including the losses.
<br>Time Complexity - O(n log n)
<br>Tip : Try to implement the program by calculating the (profit-loss) and weight ratios in place of profit and wieght ratios in the fractional knapsack

* Application of Greedy Approach - Yuck Donald's is considering opening a series of restaurants along Quaint Valley Highway (QVH). The n possible locations are along a straight line, and the distances of these locations from the start of QVH are, in miles and in increasing order, m1, m2, ...mn. The constraints are as follows:
<br>* At wach location, Yuckdonal's may open atmost one restaurant. The expected profit from opening a shop at location i is pi, where pi>0 and i=1,2,...n.
<br>* Any two restaurants must be atleast k miles apart, where k is a positive integer.
<br>Give an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum expected total profit subject to the given constraints
<br>Time Complexity - O(n^2)
